# Michael Lumula - Portfolio

My personal portfolio website featuring a cyber/terminal aesthetic. It showcases my work in cybersecurity, IT infrastructure, and DevOps.

## Overview

The site is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. No frameworks or build steps required.

Key features:
- Responsive design with a mobile-friendly menu
- Matrix rain background effect
- Terminal-style typing animations
- Blog section for technical posts

## Running Locally

Just open `index.html` in any browser.

## Customization

Most of the styling is handled in `style.css` using CSS variables for easy color tweaking. The matrix effect and other interactive elements are in `script.js`.
